# Cluster-Marketplace
The project focuses on designing a high-trust, guided decision flow that helps hardware startup founders confidently assemble execution-ready local teams instead of navigating traditional hiring marketplaces.

🧠 Problem Context

Hardware startups often struggle to move from idea to execution due to:

Unclear understanding of required technical roles

Confusion between freelancers vs service companies

Low trust in talent quality

Uncertain cost and timeline expectations

Fear of execution failure mid-project

These challenges lead to decision paralysis and delayed product development.

🎯 Objective

To design a decision-support UX system (not a job portal) that:

Guides founders step-by-step

Builds trust before commitment

Makes execution expectations explicit

Reduces ambiguity around deliverables, cost, timelines, and collaboration

🧩 Solution Overview

The platform uses a guided flow instead of free search or browsing:

Problem Context – Establish founder pain points

City Selection – Anchor execution to local ecosystems

Product Understanding – Capture intent via simple questions

Execution Clarity – Clearly define:

Deliverables (phase-wise)

Cost & timeline ranges

Collaboration and accountability model

Review & Confirm Proposal – Low-pressure commitment without payment

This approach prioritizes clarity, trust, and realistic execution planning.

✨ Key UX Highlights

Recommendation over search to reduce cognitive load

Milestone-based deliverables instead of vague scope

Cost & timeline shown as ranges with honest explanations

Explicit collaboration & risk handling (backup experts, escalation)

No ratings, reviews, or early payments to avoid false confidence

🧠 What Makes This Unique

Designed for hardware realities, not software assumptions

Treats trust as a process, not a badge

Focuses on execution clarity, not talent browsing

Emphasizes local collaboration and accountability
